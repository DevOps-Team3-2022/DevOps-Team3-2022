## Requirements gathering flow
- Identify and understand project requirements from user/ client (e.g. through interview, survey, etc.)
- Identify functional and non-functional requirements

## Backlog issues creation flow
- Establish site for creation of backlog/ issue tracking (e.g. Trello, Jira)

## Git usage strategy
Branches will be set up for each different feature or component of the final product, each branch will be named after the feature or component's name.

Once a feature or component is complete, it will be merged into the main branch.
Pull requests will be used to review and approve code changes before merging.
Continuous integration and continuous deployment workflows will be used to automate testing and deployment

## Change requirement strategy
Identify and document the change request and its impact on the project. All members will review the change request to ensure everyone is clear. Create a user story and issue relating to the new requirements and rank the new issues relative to the ranking of the previous issues.

## Deployment strategy
The project will be deployed at the end of each sprint. The main branch will be deployed onto the a test staging environment to ensure it is working as intended. Any final changes will be made here and a pull request will be made with the main branch to copy over the changes.
